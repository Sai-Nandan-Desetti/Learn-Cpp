main()
    Ask user to enter two floating point numbers. (Use doubles)
        Store them as (say) x and y.
    Ask user for the operation:        
        If +: x + y
        If -: x - y (my assumption; could've as well been y - x)
        If *: x * y
        If /: x / y (my assumption; could've as well been y / x)
        Else: Don't print anything.

Each of the operations can have its own function.
Because, sometimes, additional checks may have to be performed on the input data
before we apply the operation. Eg: Check if y is zero before we divide.

Store the functions in operations.cpp
Create a pairing header file and include this in main.cpp

Functions:
Each function takes two double inputs and outputs a double.

The logic for printing the result should be put in a separate function
(because the code for that is reusable).
1. Where should this function be defined? In main.cpp?
    Or group all the functions pertaining to arithmetic operations and the print in a single functions.cpp?

    Or have a separate display.cpp just for the print function?
        Then, this must have a matching header file that must be included in main.cpp.

2. How do you print the result when y = 0 and the operation = /?
    If the print function takes a double value as an argument, then what value will represent
    the divide-by-zero situation?

Well, the compiles seems to handle the divide-by-zero case; it treats it as 'inf'.
