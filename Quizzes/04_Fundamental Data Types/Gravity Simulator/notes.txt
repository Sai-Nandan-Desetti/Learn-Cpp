A Free Fall Simulator

Given:
    Height of the tower (assume it's meters)

To calculate:
    Height of the ball from the ground in a given time.
        - Time is given in seconds.
        - Output distance is in meters.
        - Compute using the formula given.

Files:
    - io.cpp
    - simulation.cpp
        - contains the function that computes the desired height
    - main.cpp


simulation.cpp
    - double ballHeight(double seconds, double heightOfTower)
        - height of tower - distance_traveled
        - distance traveled is computed by the given formula.

io.cpp    
    - Generally, there's a separate I/O module with CLASS definitions for
    customized input and output streams.
    - Having separate functions for handling the display turned out to be useful
    because of handling the special case of when the ball is reached.
	
Important:
	- Understand why `const` was used.
	- ballHeight() returns just `double`
		- returning `const double` threw a warning: "type specifiers ignored for return types"
			- because you're anyway going to COPY the value to some variable, say, `x`
			- if you want the value to remain constant, then you've to define `x` as constant,			
		- and if warnings are treated as errors, then that's an error.
