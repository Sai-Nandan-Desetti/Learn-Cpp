Integer Switch-Case Calculator

Given:
    - Two integers
    - character corresponding to one of the following operations: +, -, *, /, *

To do:
    - calculate the (integral) result of the given operation


void calculate(int x, int y)
    - Get the operation from the user
    - Use switch case to compute the appropriate result   
    - Use `default` to print an error message
    - U cannot return an integer
        - What value would you choose to return?
            - Zero?
            - Then, how would you distinguish if the returned value was due to a valid
            or an invalid operation?
            - With any other value the problem is same.
        - We haven't learnt about exceptions yet.
    - Just display the result within the function itself
