Inverted Number Triangle

Given:
    - A given number triangle to print

To do:
    - Print the triangle as desired

- Start with n = 5. Print all the way to 1.
- Start with n = 4. Print all the way to 1.
.
.
.
- Each time start with a number 1 less than the previous row...
... until you get to n = 1.
Then, stop.

- Have two loops:
    - Outer loop: sets the `row_start` to the appropriate value
        - i.e. in each iteration it decrements by 1
        - Inner loop: 
            -start from `row_start` and print all the way to 1
        - stops when row_start == 0
