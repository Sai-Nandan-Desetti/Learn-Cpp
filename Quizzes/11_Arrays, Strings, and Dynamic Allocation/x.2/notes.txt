Best practices:
    
    1. If you define numberOfStudents as an unsigned integer type, what do you think happens
    when the user enters a negative integer?

    2. Have an alias for std::vector<Student> as Students.

    3. You've initialized a vector of Students.
    When you call getStudent() again you're creating a new Student!

    4. Use a reference in the for-each loop when dealing with structures.
    Use const if you're not going to modify the struct in the loop.

    5. Use auto to deduce the type in the loop.
