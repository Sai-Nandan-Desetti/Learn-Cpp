Bitwise Rotate Left

Given:
     - a binary number
        - containing 4 bits
        - represented as bitset<4>

To do:
    - compute its left rotation

Example:
    rotl(1001) -> 0011


std::bistset<4> rotl(std::bitset<4> bits):
    - test the left-most bit
    - shift left by 1 bit
    - set the same value to the right-most bit

IMPORTANT: We count from right to left; starting from 0.
