 * \n
 * A bitwise rotation is like a bitwise shift,
 * except that any bits shifted off one end are added back to the other end.
 * For example \c 0b1001u \c << \c 1 would be \c 0b0010u, but a left rotate by \c 1 would result in \c 0b0011u instead.
 *  - Implement a function that does a left rotate on a \c std::bitset<NUM_BITS>.
 *  - Itâ€™s okay to use \c test() and \c set() included in the \c bitset header file.

 * Using \c #define, \c NUM_BITS doesn't become a variable.
 * So, you can't watch it in a debugger.
 * In VS Code you can simply hover the cursor over `NUM_BITS` to see its value.
 * But where you don't have such a luxury you'll have to observe its value using a debugger.
 * So, best to declare it as compile-time constant using \c constexpr.
