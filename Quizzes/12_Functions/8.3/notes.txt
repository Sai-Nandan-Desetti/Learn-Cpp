Square Numbers Game

Given:
    - User input:
        - lo: lower bound
        - n: number of elements    
    
To do:
    - Pick a random number in [2, 4], say, x
    - Generate squares of numbers multiplied by x starting from lo.
        - list_of_squares
    - Ask user to predict all n numbers
    - Stop when user makes a mistake
        - print the correct version only if it's not off by more than 4

Random number generation:
    - Mersenne Twister
    
Search (list_of_squares, prediction):
    - Given a user's prediction, search in the generated list of squares
    - Return that number in list_of_squares that's closest to prediction

If the closest number if off by <= 4, then print the correct version.
(See given example.)
