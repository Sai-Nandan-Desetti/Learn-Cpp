Swap Smaller Larger

Given:
    - Two integers

To do:
    - If the first number is smaller: don't swap
    - Else, swap the numbers
    - Print smaller number first, then the larger number

Is it necessary to swap?
    - Yes.
    - Because the values of `smaller` and `larger` are expected to change (if necessary).

Do we need a function?
    - We still didn't learn about passing-by-address or reference to functions.
    - It's given to use a nested block.

How to do the swap?
    - Use a temp variable.
    - Can use std::swap() from the <utility> header.
