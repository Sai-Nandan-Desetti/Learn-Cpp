 * - You are running a website, and you are trying to keep track of how much money
 * you make per day from advertising.
 * 
 * - Declare an \c Advertising struct that keeps track of how many ads youâ€™ve shown to readers,
 * what percentage of ads were clicked on by users,
 * and how much you earned on average from each ad that was clicked.
 * 
 * - Read in values for each of these fields from the user.
 * Pass the \c Advertising struct to a function that prints each of the values,
 * and then calculates how much you made for that day (multiply all 3 fields together).
