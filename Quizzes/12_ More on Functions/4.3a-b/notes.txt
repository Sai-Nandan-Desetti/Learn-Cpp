Wraparound happens when you assign a negative integer to a variable defined as an unsigned integer.
So, -1 would be the largest number representable by the data type;
-2 would be 1 less that number, and so on.

When you assign a positive integer greater than the largest possible number, then the value
that gets assigned is simply the largest possible number.

Side note: Using two's complement notation, the representation of -1 and the largest number would be same!
