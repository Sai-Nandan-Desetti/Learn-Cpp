Why define the function in a header file?
    - function templates must be defined header files
    so that the compiler what function definitions to create 
    based on the types passsed to T

    - these functions are allowed to violate the One-Definition Rule
    provided their definitions are identical

    - so defining them in a header file and including them in other files--
    even if while linking multiple definitions are seen, there's no issue

Use std::size_t for iterating and storing array size.
    - Portability
    - It's basically an unsigned integer type.
        - Whether it's unsigned int, or unsigned long, or unsigned long long
        - Implementation-dependent
